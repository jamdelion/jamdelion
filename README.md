### Hello! 👋 I'm Jo. 
*[click to hear my name](https://nmdrp.me/johumphrey)* 👂

😄 **Pronouns**: they/them

I've just started on my journey towards becoming a front-end developer, and I'm learning with a bunch of fantastic people (![@fac21](@www.github.com/fac21)) on a London-based peer-based course by the educational non-profit, [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com). 

🌱 **I’m currently learning** ...
* HTML, CSS and Javascript

💬 **I'm passionate about** ...
* Improving access to tech careers :fist: 
* Workers' and producers' [co-ops](https://www.uk.coop/) :honeybee: 
* Non-profits, and social enterprises :green_heart:

✏️ I've just started writing a blog at [jo.hashnode.dev](https://jo.hashnode.dev).

⚡ **Fun fact**: I started learning to rollerblade over lockdown in summer 2020. When I'm not coding, you can probably find me flailing on ramps at one of the local skateparks! 😅
