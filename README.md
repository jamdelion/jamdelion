### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jo.

I've just started on my journey towards becoming a front-end developer, and I'm learning with a bunch of fantastic people on a London-based peer-based course by the educational non-profit, [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com). 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
* HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript

ðŸ’¬ I'm passionate about ...
* Improving access to tech careers :fist: 
* Workers' and producers' [co-ops](https://www.uk.coop/) :honeybee: 
* Non-profits, and social enterprises :green_heart:

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them

âš¡ Fun fact: I started learning to rollerblade over lockdown in summer 2020, and now I'm a little obsessed!
