### Hello! 👋 I'm Jo. 
*[click to hear my name](https://nmdrp.me/johumphrey)* 👂

😄 **Pronouns**: they/them

I've just started on my journey towards becoming a front-end developer, and I'm learning with a bunch of fantastic people (![@fac21](@www.github.com/fac21)) on a London-based peer-based course by the educational non-profit, [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com). Check out our projects at ![https://fac21.github.io/projects-gallery/](https://fac21.github.io/projects-gallery/).

🌱 **I’m currently learning** ...
* Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL

💬 **I'm passionate about** ...
* Improving access to tech careers :fist: 
* Workers' and producers' [co-ops](https://www.uk.coop/) :honeybee: 
* Non-profits, and social enterprises :green_heart:

✏️ I've just started writing a blog at [jo.hashnode.dev](https://jo.hashnode.dev).

⚡ **Fun facts**
* I started learning to rollerblade over lockdown in summer 2020. When I'm not coding, you can probably find me flailing on ramps at one of the local skateparks! 😅
* My other main hobby is playing the drums in a 10-piece band, called [Colonel Spanky's Love Ensemble](https://colonelspankys.co.uk)! 🥁 🎵 🎸 🎺
